A basic save editor for Kingdoms and Castles.

This allows you to edit your map, even maps that are not in creative mode.

## IMPORTANT
Please note, while editing your save, that the system automatically creates a backup. Indeed, errors can happen, some that are understood and some where I don't know why it is happening. A few rules you should remember when editing your save:

* Editing a tile were a building is will make your map unloadable if you change from land to water (changing the fertility is fine)
* Changing the deep water tiles into shallow water may make the map unloadable, especially at the borders of the map (I don't know why, and don't know precisely where/when it happens)
* A map must have a basic number of land tiles.
